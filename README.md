## About the Video Course
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps which helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. It also provides you with a great developer experience, such as live code editing combined with a time-traveling debugger. Redux can be used together with any view library, not just React! Managing state in an application is critical to developers and is often done unsystematically. Redux provides a solution which will help your applications behave consistently. It is an evolution, helping you avoid the complexity found in Flux on how applications are built with the Elm language.

This course starts off with a practical introduction to Redux and how it fits into the JavaScript ecosystem. Moving ahead you will understand how to use Redux with your application and work with ES6/7, Reducers, firing actions, Thunks and Selectors. You will learn the rules of working with Redux and advanced concepts to configure your application. We will spend the last half of the course applying the Redux concepts we have learned to a real-world application - a messaging board similar to Reddit that is written in React. By taking this completed example application you witness how Redux can dramatically simplify the development of your application.By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to apply all the concepts used here to a real project and you will know exactly why you should use Redux for building larger applications.
